# 🔮 Spiritual Format Resolution Guide

## Issue Resolution: File Command Format Error

### 🚨 Original Problem
```
Unable to process file command 'output' successfully.
Invalid format '✨ Transform Lichtara OS into institutional-ready platform with vibrational GitHub infrastructure'
```

### ✅ Solution Implemented

The issue was caused by a system not recognizing the spiritual/emoji-prefixed formatting conventions used throughout Lichtara OS. This has been resolved by implementing:

1. **Format Validator** (`.github/scripts/format-validator.js`)
2. **Unicode-Safe File Processor** (`.github/scripts/unicode-processor.js`)
