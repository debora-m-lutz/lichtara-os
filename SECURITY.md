## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Lichtara OS seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by emailing us at:
**security@lichtara-os.org**

If this email address is not available, please create a private security advisory through GitHub's security advisory feature.

### What to Include

To help us better understand and resolve the issue, please include as much of the following information as possible:

- **Steps to reproduce** the vulnerability
- **Potential impact** of the vulnerability
- **Suggested mitigation** (if you have any ideas)
- **Your contact information** for follow-up questions

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
- **Status Updates**: We will provide status updates every 5-7 days until resolution
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 90 days

### What to Expect

- If the vulnerability is **accepted**, we will work on a fix and coordinate disclosure timing with you
- If the vulnerability is **declined**, we will provide a clear explanation of why it doesn't qualify as a security issue
- We will keep you informed throughout the process and notify you when the fix is deployed

### Recognition

- We maintain a security hall of fame to recognize security researchers who help improve our platform
- We are happy to credit you for your discovery (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- For significant vulnerabilities, we may offer a token of appreciation

### Responsible Disclosure

We request that you:
- Give us reasonable time to investigate and fix the issue before public disclosure
